# MEng-Module-1

Principal Files:
- Calculator.java
- Main.java

Concepts demonstrated in the code example:

1) Communication: The program is self-explanatory since is intended to help people to do simple calculations with two positive numbers
2) Simplicity: The "Main" method uses the basic functionality of the program as simple as possible
3) Flexibility: The "Calculator.java" class is able to grow to satisfy new requirements or to improve the existing ones
4) Local Consequences: Any future change into the Calculator methods won't impact entire functionality
5) Duplication: There are an small "duplication between "showResult" and "showMessage" methods
6) Symmetry: Calculator's methods are intended to follow a balanced symmetry (all methods have same parameters and same life-time)
7) Declarative Expression: The program it-self is intended to express its purpose by its own
8) Rate of Change: The elements have not explicit code separation by change rate
